Akephalos is an interface for HTMLUnit, exposing it's headless browsing power
to Capybara. The only assumption made is that you are using Capybara and have
a java runtime available.

When running tests with ruby (1.8.7, 1.9.1), akephalos will expose its client
over DRb from a java server. When running with jruby the client will be
embedded in process.

Setup
=====

Using akephalos is as simple as requiring it and setting Capybara's javascript
driver:

  require 'akephalos'
  Capybara.javascript_driver = :akephalos

Running for Cucumber
====================

When akephalos is required from a cucumber environment, it will only run for
features tagged with @akephalos. Set Capybara's javascript_driver to
also use akephalos for features tagged as @javascript.
