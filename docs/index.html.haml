    Akephalos is a full-stack headless browser for integration testing with
    Capybara. It is built on top of [HtmlUnit](http://htmlunit.sourceforge.com),
    a GUI-less browser for the Java platform, but can be run on both JRuby and
    MRI with no need for JRuby to be installed on the system.

    ## Installation
%aside
  :bash
    gem install akephalos

    ## Setup

    Configuring akephalos is as simple as requiring it and setting Capybara's
    javascript driver:

%aside
  :code
    require 'akephalos'
    Capybara.javascript_driver = :akephalos

    ## Basic Usage

    Akephalos provides a driver for Capybara, so using Akephalos is no
    different than using Selenium or Rack::Test. For a full usage guide, check
    out Capybara's DSL [documentation](http://github.com/jnicklas/capybara). It
    makes no assumptions about the testing framework being used, and works with
    RSpec, Cucumber, and Test::Unit.

    Here's some sample RSpec code:

%aside
  :code
    describe "Home Page" do
      before { visit "/" }
      context "searching" do
        before do
          fill_in "Search", :with => "akephalos"
          click_button "Go"
        end
        it "returns results" { page.should have_css("#results") }
        it "includes the search term" { page.should have_content("akephalos") }
      end
    end
